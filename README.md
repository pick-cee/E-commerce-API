Products are added in to by admins, they also have the privilege to update, view and delete products.
<br><br>
Users can add in products to their carts, they can remove products, view their carts and delete it entirely.
<br><br>
After a successful shopping, users can then proceed to make an order and subsequently make payments.
<br><br>
The payment gateway API used was Paystack, with this, users have the ability to pay with their card or USSD. When a selection is made, it initialises the transaction and then subsequently it verifies it and the users are shown a success message.
<br><br>
The admins have the privileges of:
<br>
1. Viewing the profiles of users.
<br>
2. Adding, updating, viewing and deleting products.
<br>
